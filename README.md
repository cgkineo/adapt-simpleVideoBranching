# adapt-simpleVideoBranching  

**Simple Video Branching** is a *question component* that presents the learner with a video, followed by a question about that video - optionally followed by two 'outcome' videos - one for a correct answer, one for an incorrect answer - ending with a 'results' screen. The 'outcome' videos and results can also be shown further down the page by linking a videoOutcome component to this one.
